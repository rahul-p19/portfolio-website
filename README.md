# portfolio-website
This repository contains the code for my portfolio website.

I got the domain name for free for participating and completing some tasks in MLH's Global Hack Week. It's available to me for a limited time, after which I'll have to switch to a normal github pages url.

This website has been made with plain HTML and CSS, and the contact form uses Web3 forms to allow me to receive messages without setting up a backend. 

I've kept the website minimalistic and clean, avoiding clutter.

We start off with a simple header that sticks to the top of the page even on scrolling down, to allow easier navigation within the webpage.

This is followed by a 'hero section', and then a small introduction about me.

Then we have my portfolio section where I display some of the work I've done - in video editing, graphic design and simple frontend web development. It contains a simple HTML and CSS slider, and provides links to further inspect the projects.

Then I included a simple contact form using Web3 forms to allow users to seamlessly provide feedback.

We then finish off with a footer with my name, social media links and email address.

Any feedback or questions are welcome. Hope you like it!
