# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website.

### Domain Name

I got the domain name for free for participating and completing some tasks in MLH's Global Hack Week. It's available to me for a limited time, after which I'll have to switch to a normal github pages url.

### Tech Stack

This website has been made with plain HTML and CSS, and the contact form uses Web3 forms to allow me to receive messages without setting up a backend. 

### Description

This minimalist website contains an introduction and some information about me, followed by some of the projects I've worked on and then a contact me section.

### Directions

You can visit the website at [rahulpandey.co](https://rahulpandey.co) or download the code from this repository, and then open it using the Live Server extension on VS Code.

> Any feedback or questions are welcome. Hope you like it!
